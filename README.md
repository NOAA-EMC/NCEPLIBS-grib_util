# NCEPLIBS-grib_util

This is a collection of NCEP GRIB related utilities, for GRIB1 and
GRIB2.

GRIdded Binary or General Regularly-distributed Information in Binary
form (GRIB) is a data format for meteorological and forecast data,
standardized by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). GRIB
edition 1 was approved by the WMO Working Group on Data Management
(WGDM) in 1994. GRIB edition 2 (GRIB2) was approved by the WGDM in
2003.

This is part of the [NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS)
project.

For complete documentation see
https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-grib_util/. For the NCEP WMO GRIB2
Documentation see
