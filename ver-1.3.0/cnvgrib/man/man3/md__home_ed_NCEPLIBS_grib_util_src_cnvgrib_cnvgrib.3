cnvgrib utility\&.

This command line utility program converts every GRIB
message in the input file from one GRIB edition to another\&.
It currently converts GRIB1 to GRIB2, and GRIB2 to GRIB1
using WMO master tables as well as various NCEP local tables\&.

The cnvgrib utility requires both the w3lib and g2lib
libraries\&.

We have added support for PNG and JPEG2000 image compression
algorithms within the GRIB2 standard\&.  If you would like
this converter to be able to utilize these new GRIB2 Templates,
then the g2lib must be compiled with this support enabled\&.
The README file included with the 'g2lib' library 
describes how to compile that library to support PNG and
JPEG2000, and it also lists the external libraries that
are required\&.  These libraries, if desired, will have to linked 
in when creating the cnvgrib executable\&.



Usage: cnvgrib [-h] {-g12|-g21|-g22} [-m|-m0] [-nv]
               [{-p0|-p2|-p31|-p32|-p40|-p41}]  ingribfile   outgribfile


Usage: cnvgrib  -h  For helps and shows all options


cnvgrib:  version cnvgrib-3\&.1\&.1 

Must use one of the following options:
   -g12     converts GRIB1 to GRIB2
   -g21     converts GRIB2 to GRIB1
   -g22     converts GRIB2 to GRIB2  (used to change packing option)

Optional packing options: (for use with  -g12 and -g22 only)
   -p0      simple packing
   -p2      complex packing
   -p31     complex pack with 1st order diffs
   -p32     complex pack with 2nd order diffs
   -p40     JPEG2000 encoding
   -p41     PNG encoding

Other Optional options: 
   -nv      Do not combine U, V wind components

   Use missing value management instead of bitmap
   (ONLY valid with Complex Packing options: -p2, -p31 or -p32 )

   -m      Primary missing values included within the data values
   -m0     No explicit missing values included within the data values
   -mastertable_ver_x     Master Table version where x is number from 2 to 21
