The test plans for grib_util v1.1.1 on DELL, CRAY, and IBM are in unit_test:

1. Change to grib_util.v1.1.1/unit_test
2. There are three scripts to test G2 library version 3.1.0 and grib_util v1.1.1.
   Either run them each individually or execute the run_all_tests.sh script.

   A. test_cnvgrib
   
         This script uses to test cnvgrib  
         The cnvgrib will correct the forecast hour > F252 when it convert from GRIB2 to GRIB1.
         Example:   GFS at 00Z forecast hour 264.
         NOTE:
         cnvgrib (in PROD) converted from GRIB2 to GRIB2 and coded incorrectly forecast 264 in grib1 as 8hr.
         New cnvgrib fixed and coded it at 264hr for forecast hour 264. 
   
   B. test_wgrib2.sh
   
         This script uses to test the wgrib2 in (grib_util.v1.1.1).  It is a version 2.0.7 (12/2017)
         This script uses WGRIB2 to read GFS GRIB2 file and interpolate to AWIPS 20km and 1.0 deg grids. 
   
   C. test_copygb2.sh
   
         This script uses to test the utility copygb2 which compiled with new G2 library v3.1.0
         The copygb2 will interpolate to  display contentWIPS 20km and 1.0 deg grids.


   D. test_wgrib.sh

         This script uses to test the wgrib in (grib_util.v1.1.1).  It is a version v1.8.2 (03/2017)
         This script uses WGRIB to read ecmwf file (which it contains some GRIB2 and GRIB1 records).
