# tocgrib2super

# Introduction

This program reads selected GRIB2 fields from a file, adds a flag Field
separator block and the size in bytes of the grib file, and the WMO
super header and the time stamp, adds a TOC Flag Field separator
block and WMO Header in front of each GRIB2 field, and writes them
out to a new file. The output file is in the format required for
TOC's FTP Input Service, which can be used to disseminate the GRIB2
bulletins. This service is described at
http://weather.gov/tg/ftpingest.html.

The "EXTRACT" variable in the namelist allows users to choose
whether they want the entire GRIB2 message containing the requested
field (extract=.false.), OR a GRIB2 message containing only the
requested field (extract=.true.). Both options return the same
message if the requested field is the only field in the GRIB2
message.
